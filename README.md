# Predicting Body Fat Percentage

Data Analysis
This analysis aims to understand the correlation of different body measurements as they relate to human body fat percentages. In this study, we look at data from 252 men
with measurements in the following areas:

Density determined from underwater weighing
Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation
Age (years)
Weight (lbs)
Height (inches)
Neck circumference (cm)
Chest circumference (cm)
Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
Hip circumference (cm)
Thigh circumference (cm)
Knee circumference (cm)
Ankle circumference (cm)
Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
Forearm circumference (cm)
Wrist circumference (cm)

The goal of this study is to further understand the correlation these different body measurements with body fat percentages. Further exploration of this project can be 
to use this data to develop a model to predict the body density. Then using Siri's equation to predict the body fat percentage.
