# Predicting Body Fat Percentage

This analysis aims to understand the correlation of different body measurements as they relate to human body fat percentages. In this study, we look at data from 252 men
with measurements in the following areas:

Density determined from underwater weighing
Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation
Age (years)
Weight (lbs)
Height (inches)
Neck circumference (cm)
Chest circumference (cm)
Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
Hip circumference (cm)
Thigh circumference (cm)
Knee circumference (cm)
Ankle circumference (cm)
Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
Forearm circumference (cm)
Wrist circumference (cm)

The goal of this study is to further understand the correlation these different body measurements with body fat percentages and determine a model to predict body fat percentage. There are multiple ways to determine body fat percentage ranging from skinfold calipers, digital body fat monitors, and body composition analyzers - all of which can be innacurate and expensive. This project aims to deliver a model to predict body fat percentage with a reasonable amount of accuracy.
